Please don't call unless you have to
Say i'll be fine but no one asked you
I give a fuck about your point of view
Blinds closed, decompose i'm a statue

Discontent with chasing shadows
So hang my future from the gallows
You always think you know what's best for me
But if i disappear tomorrow would i still feel fucking helpless
If i disappear tomorrow would you even fucking notice

Oh, choke slam, oh
Helmsley got planted
Give her what she deserved

Please don't call unless you have to
Say i'll be fine but no one asked you
I give a fuck about your point of view
Blinds closed, decompose i'm a statue

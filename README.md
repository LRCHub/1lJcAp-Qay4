# Kittie – Choke

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
You're hidden by
Your good looks
Your fake smile
I loved you but
It took me
A long while
To realize
You don't even care
All the feelings
You had none
There's only one word
That describes you
And that's a "hypocrite."
I looked over you
I looked over me
Look at you and smile
You fucking pedophile
I looked over you
I looked over me
Look at you and smile
Pedophile!
Seduction!
tied down!
Decapitation!
Insane!
Oh! You're not my friend!
This is the end!
Suck.....it!
My eyes were never dry
It's all done
It wasn't real
And all but it was fun
Was I not good enough for you
king?
Was I not good enough for you
king?
Was I not good enough for you
king?
I guess not
I looked over you
I looked over me
Look at you and smile
You fucking pedophile
I looked over you
I looked over me
Look at you and smile
Pedophile!
Seduction!
Torture!
Decapitation!
Insane!
Oh! You're not my friend!
This is the end!
......Suck It!
You're not the king
You never will be
How could you say
That you liked me?
You're not the king
You never will be
How could you say
That you liked me?
You're not the king
You never will be
How could you say
That you liked me?
You're not the king
You never will be
Hope you choke!
